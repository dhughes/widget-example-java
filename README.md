# Widget Example

This project contain many revisions of an application I created as a demonstration for my Java class. The master branch contains a basic command line versions of the application. Over time this is expanded to include more advanced tools. For example, there are several branches related to Spring, JPA, REST APIs, basic (non-Spring) security, and more.
